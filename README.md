# openscad-jeep
An OpenSCAD model of the [Jeep Wrangler TJ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeep_Wrangler_(TJ)).  Eventually, it might expand to other models.

## Goals:

The goals for this project are to produce an OpenSCAD model of a Jeep Wrangler (TJ) at varying levels of detail and trim.  The desire is that people will create branches for updates to specific types (below).  Becoming more accurate as a representation would then
simple be a PR/rebase process.
 
* Hard top and soft (factory)
* Automatic and manual transmission
* Unlimited
* Various trim levels
  * SE
  * X
  * Sport
  * Sahara

## Specifics

* Factory panel/beam/bolt placement - This is so modifications make sense
* Distinguishing custom modifications
* Engine compartment metrics
* Passenger compartment metrics

## Why
I am doing customization of my jeep. In some cases this is radical.  So having a model to test changes on would be awesome.  Having the ability to share those, and to include other people's things, would also be great.

Since my OpenSCAD skills are very minimal, I hope that people will help me refine the model.
